# Triple J Hottest 100
Visualisation and analysis of data from Triple J's Hottest 100 countdown since it's inception in 1993. 

Triple J is a local radio station in Australia, known for it's focus on Australian artists and less "mainstream" music. Since 1989 Triple J has held The Hottest 100, a poll where the public can vote for their top 10 favourite songs from the previous year. The results are then aired on Triple J in late January, with "Hottest 100 Day" colloquially becoming it's own national holiday.

Conditions of a songs eligibility relate to time frame of release and it must have been played on Triple J during the year of voting. 

Note: I chose to only use data from 1993 onwards as the first countdowns allowed for voting of songs from any year.

I was interested in seeing trends in the data from each year, as music trends change and determine if Australian listeners have a favourite artist or genre.
